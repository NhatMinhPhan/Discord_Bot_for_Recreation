This is a Discord bot which is not reliant on databases and is programmed for practice and non-professional purposes.
This bot facilitates activities comprising of counting, hangman and rock paper scissors.

Enter /help for commands.

The following libraries and packages are crucial in this bot's operations, all of which were installed via the Python PIP:
_Discord.py, requests,_ and _python-dotenv_. The [Random Word API](https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/home) is also integrated for the hangman features.

### Instructions
1. Install the libraries above: _Discord.py, requests,_ and _python-dotenv_.
2. Once all the libraries above are installed, an .env file is to be created, which must include the following information:
- DISCORD_TOKEN: the token of the Discord bot for which the Python scripts are to run
- MY_SERVER: the ID of the Discord server in which the Discord bot runs
3. Ensure all the Python scripts and the .env file must be in the same directory.
4. Run [main.py](https://github.com/NhatMinhPhan/Discord_Bot_for_Recreation/blob/db637f08f70c37aaed770f3d2eb3de232d29d254/main.py). And that's it!

### Description of individual files

- [counting.py](https://github.com/NhatMinhPhan/Discord_Bot_for_Recreation/blob/db637f08f70c37aaed770f3d2eb3de232d29d254/counting.py): The script that processes counting messages, which originate only from the #counting channel.
